# Omi Alpha 2 Omi Beta
OMI mvp works... But it is too dirty, too draft. And not easy enough for people to jump in. So let's split what have been done to check what need to be done.

From now on, OMI is bigger than me. I want to do a community driven tool that I use along the community to make it evolve.
For that I need a lighter and more modular version.
That the reason of the Beta version.

The other problem is that Module I create for OMI need to be usable outside of OMI for my other project. And I can't do that in current version of OMI.
